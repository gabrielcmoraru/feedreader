#Feedreader Udacity Nanodegree Project [Info](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/18/view)
===============================
## This is a project for unit testing with [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine)
## Use local by downloading the files and running index.html from the main folder or browse [online](https://gabrielcmoraru.github.io/feedreader/)

Tests done:
- RSS feeds have are defined, have a name and a valid URL
- The menu functionality on click and his initial state
- Feed loader functions according to specification and loads at least 1 feed and it updates on new feed load

After doing this exercise I can definitely say I did learn a new way of thinking coding, it seems a bit more hard at the beginning and at first glance but helps on the long run.
